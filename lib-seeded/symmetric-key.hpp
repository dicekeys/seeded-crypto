/**
 * @brief A SymmetricKey can be used to seal and unseal messages.
 * This SymmetricKey class can be (re) derived from a seed using
 * set of recipe specified in @ref recipe_format.
 * So, you can use this symmetric-key to seal a message, throw the
 * key away, and re-generate the key when you need to unseal the
 * message so long as you still have the original seed and
 * recipe.
 *  
 * Sealing a message (_plaintext_) creates a _ciphertext which contains
 * the message but from which observers who do not have the UnsealingKey
 * cannot discern the contents of the message.
 * Sealing also provides integrity-protection, which will preven the
 * message from being unsealed if it is modified.
 * We use the verbs seal and unseal, rather than encrypt and decrypt,
 * because the encrypting alone does not confer that the message includes
 * an integrity (message authentication) code to prove that the ciphertext
 * has not been tampered with.
 * 
 * The seal operation is built on LibSodium's crypto_secretbox_easy function,
 * but despite it's name the construct isn't as easy as it should be.
 * The caller must store both the ciphertext AND a 24-byte nonce
 * (crypto_secretbox_NONCEBYTES = 24).
 * Hence, the SymmetricKey seal operation outputs a _composite_ ciphertext
 * containing the nonce followed by the "secret box" ciphertext generated by LibSodium.
 * Since the "secret box" is 16 bytes longer than the message size
 * (crypto_secretbox_MACBYTES = 16),
 * the composite ciphertext is is 40 bytes longer than the message length
 * (24 for then nonce, plus the 16 added to create the secret box)
